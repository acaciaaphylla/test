# Contributing 

In actual fact, please don't add anything to my baby repository :( <sup>I have no idea what's going on and it is already complicated enough!</sup>

But if the urge to do so is simply uncontrollable, please submit a [GitHub pull request.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Will update this page if this repo becomes something other than a sandbox.
